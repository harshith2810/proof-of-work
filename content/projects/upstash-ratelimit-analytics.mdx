## Role

Business Development and Community Lead

## Scope of Work

**Business Development**  
Leveraging my extensive network and understanding of the Web3 space, I've helped identify and develop strategic partnerships for Feature. These partnerships have expanded our reach and improved our brand visibility, while also introducing our platform to a variety of new potential users.

**Marketing:**  
I've played a significant role in developing and implementing marketing strategies for Feature. This includes coordinating promotional campaigns, creating marketing content, and engaging with our audience on various social media platforms. My goal is to effectively communicate the value and potential of Feature, attract new users, and foster a strong and engaged community.

**Twitter Thread Writing.**  
As a part of my role, I've consistently created and managed Twitter threads to promote Feature and share our progress. These threads not only help increase brand awareness, but they also provide valuable insights into our vision, achievements, and future plans. They serve as a platform for us to engage with our community, answer questions, and receive feedback.

These additional responsibilities have given me a holistic understanding of the operations at Feature. They have enabled me to effectively engage with our community, communicate our brand value, and drive growth and user acquisition.

**Engaging with the Community Members on Discord.**  
Engaging with the Community Members on Discord while having an extensive working knowledge of Discord best practices.

**Share inputs and execution pointers on Community Building.**  
With my passion and love for Web3, Creator Economy, Metaverse, collectibles, blockchain & crypto, and collectibles I share notes on Community Building.

**Resolving support tickets for community members with a low Turn Around Time.**  
With my background in Web2 running a Remote Call Center Startup, Customer Service and satisfaction is very important for me. I also understand that the customer may not always be right, but as a businessperson we must always treat 

**Writing [Threads on Twitter](https://www.notion.so/Twitter-Threads-6a0f000e74bf4b13b8cde4349b505d90?pvs=21) to spread brand awareness.**  
I enjoy creating threads on a variety of topics to express my thoughts and opinions. [Feature.io](http://feature.io/) and how we are influencing the future of streaming have been the subject of several pointers I have started on Twitter.

**Help Onboard newcomers to the Discord server.**  
Discord is not initially user-friendly, and those who are unfamiliar with the software may feel overwhelmed just by glancing at it. This is one of the reasons why some members of the community don't participate in Discord chat as frequently. I am aware of the worry and assist new server users with settling in and becoming comfortable in the community.

**Resolving technical issues during mint cycle.**  
A total of 92 million people visited the [Love, Death + Robot](https://lovedeathandart.com/) campaign that [Feature](https://feature.io/powered-by) created with Netflix, and around 140,000 collectibles were minted. Our entire community management team put a lot of effort into correcting the minting and technical challenges the community members were experiencing since "With great numbers, comes great responsibility.”

**Coordinate with team members internally.**  
The community managers are a team of 10, while the feature team has 30 members. We collaborate on [Asana](https://www.asana.com/) and talk on weekly calls to exchange community reports and weekly action plans.

**Resolving basic queries on Discord regarding the brand.**  
With my superior people/customer relationship skills with the ability to interact successfully across cultures I am able to resolve basic queries on Discord as I exude high level of patience.
