## Project Details

**Love Death + Robots**

Nine Love, Death + Robots QR-Coded Artworks were strewn across the digital and physical world - available to be minted as NFTs or right-click and saved the old-fashioned way. Each piece of special, limited edition imagery reflects Love, Death + Robots’ unique collective of visual perspectives and creative storytelling from Volume 3. To collect them all, fans had to be vigilant.

In total, *131,690* Love, Death + Robots Artworks were minted.

Love, Death + Robots is for you, the fans. That’s why all nine of the special edition Love, Death + Robots Artworks were available to be downloaded for free. If you decided to mint them, fans only had to pay a small fee known as gas – a variable operating cost required to power transactions on the Ethereum network.

Emmy-winning animated anthology Love, Death + Robots returns with a third volume executive produced by Tim Miller (Deadpool, Terminator: Dark Fate) and David Fincher (MINDHUNTER, Mank). Terror, imagination and beauty combine in new episodes which stretch from uncovering an ancient evil to a comedic apocalypse, telling startling short stories of fantasy, horror and science-fiction with trademark wit and visual invention.
